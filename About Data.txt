The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). The dataset has been preprocessed and adapted for the homework. Each observation is described by 9 feature columns and a class column that identifies whether the object is a
galaxy or not. All continuous values have been discretized. The description of features are as follows:

* redshift = Redshift value based on the increase in wavelength
* alpha = Right Ascension angle (expressed in zodiac signs)
* delta =  Declination angle  
* green_filter = Green filter in the photometric system
* near_infrared_filter = Near Infrared filter in the photometric system
* cosmic_ray_activity = Cosmic ray activity
* red_filter = Red filter in the photometric system
* ultraviolet_filter = Ultraviolet filter in the photometric system
* infrared_filter = Infrared filter in the photometric system
